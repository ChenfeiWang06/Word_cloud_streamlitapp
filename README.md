Word Cloud Generator
This app allows user to upload there paragraph and it will generate a wordcloud based on content.
It is easily to create by using streamlit app and docker.

I have already uploaded this to my dockerhub, so if you want to try, just use such two commands: 
  docker pull miffyeewang/nlp_wordcloud_app:latest
  docker run -d -p 8501:8501 miffyeewang/nlp_wordcloud_app:latest
You will have the port to open my app.
